## About me

I am a PhD candidate at the Silesian University of Technology. I have over 4 years of
commercial experience in the field of AI/ML, preceded by a year of experience in medical
data analysis and creating virtual environments for ML simulations. My main goal is
creating reliable and scalable state-of-the-art Data Science solutions.



## My stack:
 - Languages: Python, c++
 - Clouds: Azure, Google Cloud
 - Devops: MLOps, Docker, K8s, Github
 - Data Science Topics: Distributed computing, LLM's, Generative AI, Time-series analysis
 - ML frameworks: Pytorch, Dask, TensorFlow
